## Website for Gene Visualization

Evo-Genes is a comprehensive gene visualization system. Our system addresses the complex challenge of comparing gene similarities across species while preserving the context of the original gene structure.
Existing tools lack the ability to simultaneously examine sequence similarities and structural differences between species. Evo-Genes fills this gap by providing a web-based platform that integrates server-side and client-side programming with the extensive Ensembl database. Our system features intuitive and visually engaging comparative gene sequence analysis, emphasizing exon display to optimize gene comparison.

## Getting Started

Provide instructions on how to get started with using your project. Include prerequisites, installation steps, and basic usage guidelines.

To start use our website enter the following link: [Evo-Genes](https://evogene.cs.bgu.ac.il)
You should see the home screen below. Now choose 'Run Now' button in the middle of the screen or throw the navigation bar on the left side and click
'Run Evo-Genes'

To start use the system you should pick two Gene Ensembl IDs and copy them to text boxes shows in the screen below:

In order to do so you can shoose one of the options:
1. You can use the [Ensembl website](https://www.ensembl.org/). After you search on the website the specific gene you want to investigate you can copy the Gene Ensembl ID like in the circle on the example below (in the example the gene C1QA):

2. You can use our "Chosen Genes" on the start of the same page of our website. When clicking on one of the photos a pop up window will show and you can choose genes there and copy them to the text boxes below:
